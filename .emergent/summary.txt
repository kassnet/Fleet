The AI engineer's trajectory began with an initial struggle to acquire the correct codebase, eventually successfully cloning the FacturePro RDC application. The work then transitioned into an iterative bug-fixing process, addressing critical issues such as MongoDB ID inconsistencies, non-functional payment simulations, and UI/UX improvements by replacing native alerts with modern components. A significant phase involved implementing a comprehensive user authentication and authorization system with roles (Admin, Manager, Comptable, Utilisateur) and JWT-based protection. Recurring problems involved  errors and data loading issues due to  vs.  mismatches, which were resolved by migrating to a centralized  helper. The final major fix addressed a  error during invoice creation due to data format mismatch. The most recent task involves renaming the application from FacturePro RDC to FleetMaster, which is partially complete.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to deliver a fully functional, demonstration-ready invoicing application for freelancers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC), initially named FacturePro RDC. Key features include comprehensive CRUD for clients, products/services, and invoices; automatic stock management with low stock alerts; a simulated Stripe payment system with manual validation; and multi-currency support (USD/FC at 1 USD = 2800 FC). The application requires a professional, responsive UI with modern notifications and loading indicators, addressing initial issues like MongoDB ID incompatibility, invoice calculation errors, duplicate Mark as Paid buttons, and native pop-ups. It should be ready for real API integrations (Stripe, email). Recently, the user also requested a complete user management system with email/password authentication, admin-only registration, password reset functionality, and specific roles (Admin, Manager, Utilisateur, Comptable) with granular permissions. The latest request is to rename the application to FleetMaster.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **UUIDs**: Used for IDs to ensure JSON serializability and avoid MongoDB's ObjectIDs.
-   **Supervisor**: Process manager for , , and  services.
-   **Multi-currency**: USD/FC conversion with a configurable exchange rate.
-   **JWT Authentication**: Implemented for user authentication and authorization.
-   **Pydantic**: Data validation for backend models.
-   **Axios**: HTTP client for frontend API calls.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture, comprising a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes all backend logic including FastAPI endpoints for clients, products, invoices, payments, stock management, multi-currency conversions, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Replaced initial template with the full FacturePro RDC application logic.
        -   Modified , , ,  to correctly handle MongoDB  and uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) lookup inconsistencies, primarily using  queries.
        -   Enhanced  to automatically create payment entries for manually marked invoices.
        -   Added User, Role, and Token models, JWT authentication, password hashing (bcrypt), and authorization middleware (, ).
        -   Implemented  event to create a default admin user and protected existing API routes based on user roles (Admin, Manager, Comptable, Utilisateur).
        -   Updated default admin email domain for application renaming.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing UI, state, and API interactions. It contains routing, conditional rendering, and core application logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Replaced initial template with the complete professional UI.
        -   Modified  to correctly capture and utilize invoice uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) from API.
        -   Replaced native / with modern / system, ensuring their modals are rendered in the DOM.
        -   Integrated  for global authentication state and user roles.
        -   Migrated all  API calls to  and then further refined to use a custom  helper to ensure correct  header transmission and conditional data loading based on user roles to prevent  errors for restricted users.
        -   Fixed  errors by ensuring arrays are initialized or checked for null.
        -   Restored missing modals for product, invoice, stock, exchange rate, and movements.
        -   Modified  to transform frontend  data into the backend's expected  format to resolve  errors.
        -   Changed application name display from FacturePro RDC to FleetMaster.

<pending_tasks>
-   Continue renaming application assets and content from Facturation/Facture related terms to FleetMaster terminology, especially in the backend logic, if a complete refactoring for a fleet management system is desired. (Currently, only the display name and some UI elements have been changed).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user request to rename the application from FacturePro RDC to FleetMaster. The engineer had initiated this task by performing a search for FacturePro in the frontend and FacturePro in the backend.

Specific modifications involved:
-   **Frontend ()**: The application display name was changed.
-   **Frontend ()**: The application name in the login component was updated.
-   **Backend ()**: The default admin user's email domain for the initial creation was updated to reflect the  domain as a technical consistency, but not the display name.

The AI engineer acknowledged that a full transition from facturation concepts to fleet management would be a significant refactoring and opted to prioritize the visible name change first. The last action was to update the HTML page title, which was the continuation of the renaming process.

The application is currently considered 100% functional by the AI engineer, having successfully resolved:
-   All MongoDB ID inconsistency issues in backend CRUD operations.
-   Corrected invoice payment simulation and manual marking.
-   Replaced all native UI alerts and confirms with a modern notification system.
-   Implemented a robust JWT-based authentication system with four distinct roles (Admin, Manager, Comptable, Utilisateur) and granular route-level permissions.
-   Resolved frontend data loading issues ( errors) by migrating all API calls to an authenticated Axios helper and implementing conditional data fetching based on user roles.
-   Fixed  error during invoice creation by correctly formatting the data sent from frontend to backend.
The current state is that the core application functionality and the authentication system are fully operational, and the application's display name is being updated.
