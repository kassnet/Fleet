The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's journey with FacturApp. Initially, the focus was on validating devis functionality and providing Windows-specific deployment guidance, culminating in a successful documentation effort. A major pivot occurred when the user requested a full backend migration from FastAPI (Python) to Laravel (PHP) with MySQL. The AI engineer meticulously executed this, including dependency setup, data migration from MongoDB, and comprehensive API re-implementation, validating all functionalities through extensive backend and frontend testing. Post-migration, the user introduced a new requirement: separating user management from system settings, with strict role-based access for 'admin' and a new 'support' role. A critical misstep occurred where the AI engineer began implementing this on the *new* Laravel backend and removed existing frontend configuration, before realizing the active backend was still FastAPI. After user correction, the engineer successfully refactored the *FastAPI backend* and *React frontend* to achieve the precise role-based separation and restored the application configuration. Currently, the AI engineer is addressing a comprehensive list of 16 new UI/UX and feature enhancement requests, starting with login password visibility and footer fixes.

<product_requirements>
FacturApp is a comprehensive invoice management system, initially developed with a FastAPI backend and React frontend, utilizing MongoDB. Key features include full authentication (Admin, Manager, Comptable, Utilisateur roles), invoice/payment management (with Stripe integration), client/product/stock management, sales module (quotes, opportunities, orders), and a modern UI with dark/light themes. Initial user requests focused on making the devis (quotes) section fully functional and providing detailed instructions for local database import and VPS deployment on Windows.

A major architectural shift, now completed and validated, was the user-requested conversion of the backend from FastAPI to Laravel 11 with MySQL.

The most recent explicit requests are:
1.  **User Management Separation:** Move user account activation/deactivation exclusively to a Users page, accessible by Admin and a new Support role.
2.  **Parameters Page Restriction:** Keep system parameters (logo, app name, theme, language, system stats, exchange rate, system actions) on a dedicated Settings page, accessible *only* by the new Support role.
3.  **Comprehensive Bug/Feature List:** A list of 16 items including password visibility on login, sticky footer, dashboard hover effects, invoice cancellation/deletion (with motifs and role restrictions), stock management adjustments (add/subtract quantities, motif, stock limits during invoicing), payment history deletion (with motifs and role restrictions) and pagination, removal of validity field from new quotes, quote-to-invoice conversion, quote deletion, linking multiple opportunities to a client, and opportunity filtering.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   Backend: FastAPI (Python), Laravel (PHP)
-   Frontend: React.js
-   Databases: MongoDB, MySQL/MariaDB
-   Authentication: JWT (FastAPI & Tymon/JWT-Auth for Laravel)
-   Deployment: Docker, Docker Compose, Supervisor
-   Payment Integration: Stripe (via )
-   Scripting: Bash, PowerShell, Python (for DB utilities), PHP (Composer)

<code_architecture>
The application has evolved to support two distinct backend implementations, though the original FastAPI backend is currently active for ongoing feature development.



-   : This is the core FastAPI application. It defines data models and API endpoints for CRUD operations across the system (devis, invoices, clients, products, etc.), handles JWT authentication, multi-currency conversions, and Stripe integration.
    -   *Changes:* Significantly modified to incorporate the support role, implement granular permission functions (, ), and create dedicated API endpoints for user management () and system parameters (). Existing configuration endpoints (, ) were updated to use  permissions.
-   : The main React component managing the application's UI, state, and client-side logic.
    -   *Changes:* Heavily modified to adapt to the new role-based navigation and access for Users and Settings pages. This includes updates to the  logic, conditional rendering of UI elements, and restoration of application configuration options (logo, app name, theme, language) within the Settings page. Recent changes include adding a password visibility toggle on the login screen and fixing the sticky footer layout.
-   : This file contains the translation keys and values for the application's multi-language support.
    -   *Changes:* Updated to include translations for the new support role and various keys related to application configuration and exchange rate settings, ensuring UI consistency after the feature separation.
-   : This directory houses the entirely new Laravel 11 backend, complete with MySQL database migrations, Eloquent models, controllers, API routes, and JWT authentication. It was created as part of the backend migration from FastAPI to Laravel and successfully passed all backend and frontend tests. Although fully functional, it is not the active backend currently being modified.
    -   *Importance:* Represents a successful, comprehensive architectural shift that is ready for deployment as an alternative to the FastAPI backend.
-   : A Python script used to extract all data from the MongoDB database (used by FastAPI) into JSON files, serving as an intermediate step during the Laravel/MySQL migration for data transfer.
-   : A Python script specifically created and executed to add the new  user and assign the support role within the *FastAPI's MongoDB database*. This was crucial for testing the new role-based access controls.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Dashboard:** Add hover effect on the grid.
-   **Invoices:** Implement cancellation and deletion (with motif, restricted to manager, comptable, admin). Enforce stock control (cannot invoice more than stock).
-   **Stock Management:** Replace direct quantity input with add/subtract options, require motif for updates.
-   **Payments History:** Add deletion (with motif, restricted to manager, comptable, admin). Implement pagination.
-   **Quotes:** Remove validity field from new quotes. Add convert to invoice and delete functionalities.
-   **Opportunities:** Allow linking multiple opportunities to a client. Add filtering for searches.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on a list of 16 new bug fixes and feature enhancements provided by the user. The engineer organized these tasks into phases and commenced work on Phase 1: Interface et UX.

The specific tasks currently being addressed, all within the frontend  file, include:
1.  **Password Visibility on Login:** The functionality to toggle password visibility during user login has been successfully implemented.
2.  **Sticky Footer:** The footer has been fixed to remain at the bottom of every page, enhancing the overall layout and user experience.
3.  **Dashboard Hover Effect:** The engineer is currently poised to implement the hover effect on the dashboard grid.

This ongoing work is being performed on the existing application structure, where the FastAPI backend is the active backend interacting with the React frontend. This follows a previous correction where the engineer pivoted from modifying a newly migrated Laravel backend to the currently active FastAPI backend to fulfill user requests related to role-based access and UI separation.
